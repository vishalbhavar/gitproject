      Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907[1] – 23 March 1931) was a charismatic
      Indian revolutionary who participated in the mistaken murder of a junior
      British police officer in what was to be retaliation for the death of an
      Indian nationalist. He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of
      the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail,
      which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned
      newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab region, and
      after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern
      India. Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism, he electrified a
      growing militancy in India in the 1930s, and prompted urgent introspection
      within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually successful
      campaign for India's independence.
